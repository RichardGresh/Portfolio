This program was ran and made in vs code and should work running in terminals of other program software that supports python. One thing is that user input must be correctly formatted for both algorithms to work.
This program contains 2 algorithms, one of which is a pattern sort. The pattern sort program will contain two arrays of items and will change one array so that it will match the other in its desired pattern. The second algorithm will merge k arrays together through the use of heaps and return it into a single array that is sorted.
